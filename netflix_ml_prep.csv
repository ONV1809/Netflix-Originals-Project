Johnson is seen in footage at a political march shortly before this, at an action trying to draw attention to these hate crimes. Tragically, Johnson then becomes the next victim. Like the other suspicious deaths, Johnson's death is quickly dismissed as a ""suicide"", even though there is no evidence that Johnson was suicidal, and significant evidence that Johnson was harassed and stalked on that very night. Demonstrations are held to protest the lack of police investigation, but it is not until decades later that transgender crime advocate Victoria Cruz succeeds in getting some answers. Even after decades, many contemporaries of Johnson are still afraid to discuss on the record what happened to Johnson, the murders that took place in the Village in that era, the danger that follows many of the most marginalized in the community, and the threats that some still fear. Like the previous documentary on Marsha P Johnson, Pay it No Mind, this film relies on archival footage of the dead, letting the subjects speak for themselves. Footage of Johnson at political actions is included, though some might not notice Johnson at first at some of these actions and memorials, dressed down in jeans and a t-shirt, or jeans and a flannel shirt, with no wig. Stonewall veterans, AIDS activists, and early gender nonconforming and transgender activists are shown at these demonstrations, as well. The Gay Liberation Rally, where Sylvia Rivera gives the fiery ""You Listen Up!"" speech is also featured, along with with other interviews with Rivera and AIDS memorials with ACT UP and Gay Men's Health Crisis.",victoria cruz investigates the mysterious 1992 death of black gay rights activist and stonewall veteran marsha p johnson using archival interviews with johnson and new interviews with johnsons family friends and fellow activ,when stonewall veteran and beloved greenwich village personality marsha p johnson turned up dead shortly after gay pride in 1992 it was the latest in a series of murders gay bashings and mysterious deaths in the local gay community johnson is seen in footage at a political march shortly before this at an action trying to draw attention to these hate crimes tragically johnson then becomes the next victim like the other suspicious deaths johnsons death is quickly dismissed as a suicide even though there is no evidence that johnson was suicidal and significant evidence that johnson was harassed and stalked on that very night demonstrations are held to protest the lack of police investigation but it is not until decades later that transgender crime advocate victoria cruz succeeds in getting some answers even after decades many contemporaries of johnson are still afraid to discuss on the record what happened to johnson the murders that took place in the village in that era the danger that follows many of the most marginalized in the community and the threats that some still fear like the previous documentary on marsha p johnson pay it no mind this film relies on archival footage of the dead letting the subjects speak for themselves footage of johnson at political actions is included though some might not notice johnson at first at some of these actions and memorials dressed down in jeans and a tshirt or jeans and a flannel shirt with no wig stonewall veterans aids activists and early gender nonconforming and transgender activists are shown at these demonstrations as well the gay liberation rally where sylvia rivera gives the fiery you listen up speech is also featured along with with other interviews with rivera and aids memorials with act up and gay mens health crisis,0.12206790123456794,0.40223765432098774,2017,4,0,0,Medium

His followers hailed him for helping them to gain confidence, lose weight, and overcome physical ailments through his specialty of hot yoga. He built a franchise empire with hundreds of Bikram studios around the world. Filmmaker Eva Orner traces Choudhury from his rise in the 1970s to his disgrace in accusations of rape and sexual harassment in more recent years.

For nearly a decade in the sport, Feliks Zemdegs from Australia, has reigned unchallenged as the king of cubers, the greatest of all time. That is, until now. The cubing world was stunned when an unknown challenger named Max Park from California took home the Gold medal in 2017 and emerged onto the global stage. Since then, Max's rise to the top has been swift and steady, save for one obstacle in his way: Feliks. The two have been trading wins and world records steadily, neither one able to truly dominate while the other still competes. But rather than developing into a bitter rivalry, Feliks and Max have instead grown their competitive relationship into a tender yet complicated friendship. Max is highly autistic and his family has been using speed cubing as a means of therapy for his nascent social skills and emotional development. They would have never guessed that Max's biggest rival in speed cubing would become his biggest ally in his struggles with autism. Our story finds Max and Feliks on the threshold of another World Championship, both driven to win but both rooting for each other's success. Between the two friends, though, there can only be one champion. Who will it be?

Wullie Smith, still carrying the physical and emotional scars of the childhood death of his younger brother, is the village milkman. A young man whose potential is concealed his gently diffident exterior, Wullie is locally known for his remarkable T.F.R. (Total Football Recall) and for his not-very-secret love for Rosemary Bailey, the breathtaking daughter of Bill Bailey, a local farmer with a curious affection for his cows. Rosemary has returned briefly to her home with a college degree before she leaves again to pursue a career in the big city. The single-street village has only two pubs - the ramshackle delights of Benny's Bar, spiritual home of its charmingly eccentric clientele and the sterile modernity of Le Bistro, owned by former professional footballer and preening narcissist, George Gus. But Benny's Bar may soon be lost forever. A bet made to settle a feud between the original owners of Benny's Bar and Le Bistro was made long before anyone living in the village today can remember. The ancestral feud is to be finally resolved by the result of the annual football (soccer) contest between the two bars in this hundredth year of the contest. Past form indicates poor prospects for the Benny's Bar team which has lost for 99 years in a row. But it is only the result of this, the hundredth game, which will determine which bar is to be closed forever by the winning side.",two scottish pub football teams play each other in order to resolve a centuryold grudge with the prize for the winning team being the other teams pub,the match is a contemporary romantic comedy set in the idyllic highland village of inverdoune wullie smith still carrying the physical and emotional scars of the childhood death of his younger brother is the village milkman a young man whose potential is concealed his gently diffident exterior wullie is locally known for his remarkable tfr total football recall and for his notverysecret love for rosemary bailey the breathtaking daughter of bill bailey a local farmer with a curious affection for his cows rosemary has returned briefly to her home with a college degree before she leaves again to pursue a career in the big city the singlestreet village has only two pubs  the ramshackle delights of bennys bar spiritual home of its charmingly eccentric clientele and the sterile modernity of le bistro owned by former professional footballer and preening narcissist george gus but bennys bar may soon be lost forever a bet made to settle a feud between the original owners of bennys bar and le bistro was made long before anyone living in the village today can remember the ancestral feud is to be finally resolved by the result of the annual football soccer contest between the two bars in this hundredth year of the contest past form indicates poor prospects for the bennys bar team which has lost for 99 years in a row but it is only the result of this the hundredth game which will determine which bar is to be closed forever by the winning side,0.064247311827957,0.4895545314900153,1999,8,0,1,Medium
